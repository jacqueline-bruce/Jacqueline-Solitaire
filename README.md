# Klondyke Solitaire Web Application
## Jacqueline Bruce

Created Fall 2022

I made this website as a learning experience. You can use it to create an account, play solitaire, and keep track of your games.
You can find the deployed website here: https://jacquelinesolitaire.com/

Functionalities:

* Frontend: Login, Login with Github, Register, Profile, Change Profile, Play Solitaire, Logout
* Backend: Authenticate each move made in solitaire, send to the server
* Database: Stores User and Game information

Technologies Used:

* Javascript
* MERN Stack (Mongo DB, Express JS, React, Node JS)
* Babel, Webpack, Pug
* Deployment using AWS

The code base is private due to Vanderbilt University's Honor Code.
